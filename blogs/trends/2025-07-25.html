  <h1>Rethinking Net Zero Goals: Why Shorter-Term Targets Could Accelerate Climate Action</h1>
  <p><em>July 25, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Net zero goals are often framed as distant finish lines—targets set for 2030, 2040, or 2070. But climate science reminds us that what truly matters is not just when we decarbonize, but how quickly we reduce cumulative emissions along the way.</p>

  <p>Consider a 15-year roadmap where a country plans to install 10 GW of renewable energy annually to reach its target. If it follows a steady path—10 GW each year—the cumulative emissions over time would be much lower. However, if it only adds 2–3 GW in the initial years and ramps up rapidly near the deadline, the emissions in the earlier years remain high, contributing significantly to long-term climate impact.</p>

  <p>This delayed action creates a “last-minute sprint” scenario—overburdening infrastructure, escalating costs, and increasing risk of failure. The irony? Even if the final target is technically met, the climate damage is already done due to high cumulative emissions early on.</p>

  <p>India, for instance, now needs to accelerate renewable capacity additions to 50 GW annually to meet its 2030 targets. A smoother, earlier ramp-up would have avoided this pressure.</p>

  <p>What’s the solution? Shorter, more frequent targets—say, every five years—can ensure steady progress. They keep pressure on, drive accountability, and allow the grid, economy, and institutions to adapt more gradually.</p>

  <p>Climate action must be urgent, not just ambitious. Emphasizing frequent, near-term goals ensures we act now—not just aim for later.</p>
